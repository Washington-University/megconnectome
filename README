MEGCONNECTOME is the analysis toolbox for the MEG component to the
Human Connectome Project. Unless otherwise noted, this code is
copyright by the Human Connectome Project and its coworkers. 

See http://www.humanconnectome.org for more details.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The MATLAB code that is compiled into the megconnectome stand-alone
executable application should consist of functions. These function
m-files go into analysis_functions and in trial_functions.

The MATLAB code that represents the analysis pipeline scripts that
are executed by the megconnectome application should all be
scripts (not functions) and go into pipeline_scripts.

The build folder contains the MATLAB and shell-scripting code that
is required for building the megconnectome stand-alone executable
application.

The bin folder contains a collection of Linux shell scripts to
facilitate pipeline execution. It also contains the megconnectome
application.

The template folder contains a number of template files for 
visualization purposes.
