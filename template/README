This template 2-D channel layout allows for visualization of the
248-channel 4D MEG data in a topographic layout, as detailed on

template MRI file mni_icbm152_t1_tal_nlin_sym_09a.nii
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This template MRI nifti file has been downloaded from the website of the
McConnell Brain Imaging Centre.

It belongs to the ICBM 2009a Nonlinear Symmetric template which is a 1x1x1mm
template which includes T1w, T2w, PDw modalities, also T2 relaxometry (T2
values calculated for each subject using single dual echo PD/T2 scan), and
tissue probabilities maps. This template also includes a lobe atlas used for
ANIMAL+INSECT segmentation, brain mask, eye mask and face mask. The specific
file contains the T1 weighted map derived from 152 structural images, averaged
together after high-dimensional nonlinear registration into the common MNI152
co-ordinate system. This template file is suitable for plotting individual or
group brain activity maps in the MNI space.

template sourcemodels based on regular 3-dimensional grids in MNI-space: 
standard_sourcemodel3d4mm.mat, standard_sourcemodel3d6mm.mat and
standard_sourcemodel3d8mm.mat
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The coordinates of the dipoles that are defined on these template grids (with
regular dipole spacing of 4,6 and 8 mm) are represented in standardised MNI-space.
The subject-specific dipole grids have been created using these templates, and
after applying a non-linear warp to match the individual brain. More information
can be found on http://fieldtriptoolbox.org/template/sourcemodel
